    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dark chocolate chips (or chopped dark chocolate)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x9-inch baking pan or line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a microwave-safe bowl, combine dark chocolate chips and butter. Heat in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir in the granulated sugar until well combined.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture, stirring until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).</li>
        <li>Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before slicing into squares. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
