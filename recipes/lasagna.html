    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="This is a picture of a delicious plate of lasagna." />
<p>This lasagna is a treasured family recipe passed down from my grandmother, whose love for cooking shines through every layer. With its rich and savory flavors, it features perfectly cooked sheets of pasta, generous layers of seasoned ground beef, and a creamy, cheesy filling made from ricotta and mozzarella. Each bite is a delightful combination of textures, with the pasta providing a tender bite and the meat adding a hearty depth. </p>

  <p>  What truly makes this lasagna special is the homemade marinara sauce, simmered to perfection with fresh herbs, garlic, and just the right amount of spices. It’s baked until golden and bubbly, creating a tantalizing aroma that fills the kitchen and invites everyone to the table. This dish is more than just a meal; it’s a comforting reminder of family gatherings, laughter, and the love that goes into every bite.</p>
